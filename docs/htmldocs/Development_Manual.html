<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?fromMenu">Intellij 2.4.</a> is used as the main idea of the project. It is recomended that you install Intellij for code editing and easy running of the app but is not necessary for building and testing the code which <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> handles automatically.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account is required for the source control purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="note-for-windows-users">Note for Windows users:</h4>
