##Tic Tac Toe

##Introduction
The Tic-tac-toe game is an ancient game that first appeared in the time of the Roman Empire. Since then it has spread around the world and today it is hard to find someone 
who has never heard of it. <br />
The game is simple. Two players, X and O, take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or
diagonal row wins the game. The following example game is won by the player X.

The purpose with this assignment is to set up technical infrastructure that supports agile development. This report describes our 

##Initial design

###Class Diagram
We made a simple class diagram that displays the inital class design and will therefore most likely change something over the time during development. Still, it gives the reader 
a good insight into how the system will work. Below is our class diagram.

###Overview
 * The game is written in Java and implemented by Test Driven Development (TDD) techniques.
 * The source control is hosted in Github.
 * For organizing workflow we will use Trello.
 * The code will be written mainly in IntelliJ IDEA and Sublime Text 2. 
 * Before each push, we will use Gradle to build and test the new functionality on our own computers.
 * Travis will be used to test the code each time we push the new functionality to GitHub. 

###Programming rules
It is necessary to follow a few rules when the code is written, mainly to make the code more readable and understandable. On our first day we came up with a few rules to follow
throughout the development. We talked about what rules we usually follow when programming and why we follow those rules. When in doubt, we looked for inspiration on Google and
found the standards for each programming language and adjusted them to us.
Following are the rules we decided to use and a few examples.
